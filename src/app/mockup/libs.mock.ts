      "<span class='text-content'>When it comes to looking at cats, it's important to be aware that cats find it threatening when you make direct eye contact. To be friendly and keep them comfortable, it's best to look at them from the side or with your head slightly turned away from them. Make sure to communicate with some soft cooing noises or other gentle vocal sounds. Avoid using big, loud noises or quick movements. Additionally, offer the cat some gentle strokes or a kind pat to show that you mean no harm. Respect their need for space, and if they start to seem uncomfortable, give them the chance to move away.</span>",

    content:
      "<span class='text-content'>The fact that only around 24% of cats who enter a shelter end up getting adopted is truly heartbreaking. This means that the majority of cats in shelters never get the chance to find a forever home. This could be due to overcrowding in shelters, lack of resources, and potential adopters not being aware of the cats available for adoption.</span><br/><br/> <span class='text-content'>It is important to spread awareness and encourage people to adopt from shelters rather than buying cats from pet stores or breeders. Shelters are full of cats of all ages and personalities, each of whom deserves a chance to have a loving home.</span>",

    content:
      "<span class='text-content'>Did you know that a dog's heart beat can tell a lot about their general health? A healthy dog's heart rate should range from 60-140 beats per minute (bpm), depending on the size of the dog. Smaller breeds may have a higher heart rate, while larger breeds have a slower heart rate. Dogs that are exercising, excited, or nervous may have an increased heart rate as well.</span><br/><br/> <span class='text-content'>To check your dog's heart rate, you can place your hand over their chest or beneath their front leg to feel the beats. The rhythm of your dog's heart beat should be regular and without any extra thumps or bumps.</span>",
